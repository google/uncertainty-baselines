# Diabetic Retinopathy

In this baseline, models are trained with images of blood vessels in the eye:

The models try to predict the presence or absence of diabetic retinopathy (a binary classification task).

## Deferred Prediction

### Task Description
In Deferred Prediction, a model's predictive uncertainty is used to choose a subset of the test set for which predictions will be evaluated. In particular, the uncertainty per test input forms a ranking, and the model's performance is evaluated on the X% of test inputs with the least uncertainty. X is referred to as the _retain percentage_, and the other (100 - X)% of the data is _deferred_. Standard evaluation therefore uses a _retain fraction_ = [1], i.e., the full test set is retained. 

### Real-World Relevance
We may wish to use a predictive model of diabetic retinopathy to ease the burden on clinical practitioners. Under deferred prediction, the model refers the examples on which it is least confident to expert doctors. We can tune the _retain fraction_ parameter based on practitioner availability, and a model with well-calibrated uncertainty will have high performance on metrics such as AUC/accuracy on the retained evaluation data, because its uncertainty and predictive performance are correlated.

### Usage
* Given: trained models with varied random seeds
1.  For each model, compute deferred prediction metric results with `run_deferred_prediction.py`. 
    * The user should specify a path to the model checkpoint (`--checkpoint_dir`), its training random seed (`--train_seed`), and the type of model (e.g., 'dropout', `--model_type`). The script can be run for different models/seeds with a consistent output directory (e.g., `--output_dir='gs://uncertainty-baselines/deferred_prediction_results`). The user can set an array of retain fractions, e.g., [0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1], with the `--deferred_prediction_fractions` hyperparameter. 
    * Example usage: 
        ```
      python baselines/diabetic_retinopathy_detection/run_deferred_prediction.py --data_dir='/path/to/retinopathy/data' --num_cores=1 --use_gpu=True --checkpoint_dir='gs://uncertainty-baselines/variational_inference_checkpoint' --train_seed=42 --model_type=variational_inference --output_dir='gs://uncertainty-baselines/deferred_prediction_results'
        ``` 
2. Plot results with `plot_deferred_prediction.py`.
    * Each plot will contain deferred prediction curves for a particular metric, and one or many model types.
    * To generate a plot for a particular model type:
        ```
        python baselines/diabetic_retinopathy_detection/plot_deferred_prediction.py --results_dir='gs://uncertainty-baselines/deferred_prediction_results/variational_inference' --plot_dir='.' --model_type=variational_inference
        ```
      where the `--results_dir` should point to the subdirectory of a particular type of model, as generated by `run_deferred_prediction.py`.
    * To generate a plot for all model types stored under the `--results_dir` (and also found in the `DEFERRED_PREDICTION_MODEL_TYPES` list in the` plot_deferred_prediction.py` file):
        ```
        python baselines/diabetic_retinopathy_detection/plot_deferred_prediction.py --results_dir='gs://uncertainty-baselines/deferred_prediction_results' --plot_dir='.'
        ```
