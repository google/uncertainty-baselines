"""This script details how experimental results can be obtained from a directory of TensorBoard results, each contained in a subdirectory.

This is done by writing to a public TensorBoard.

Steps:
  1. Create the TensorBoard; e.g., `tensorboard dev upload --logdir '.'`
  2. Check the experiment ID, which will be printed from the above command.
  3. Execute this script as `python parse_tensorboards.py {experiment_id}`,
    which writes out the result as `results.tsv`.
  4. Optionally, delete the public TensorBoard with
    `tensorboard dev delete --experiment_id {experiment_id}`
